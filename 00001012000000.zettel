The API (short for ""**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface"") is the primary way to communicate with a running Zettelstore.
Most integration with other systems and services is done through the API.
The [[web user interface|00001014000000]] is just an alternative, secondary way of interacting with a Zettelstore.

=== Background
The API is HTTP-based and uses JSON as its main encoding format for exchanging messages between a Zettelstore and its client software.

There is an [[overview zettel|00001012920000]] that shows the structure of the endpoints used by the API and gives an indication about its use.

While JSON is the main encoding format, it is possible to retrieve zettel representations in other formats.
If you want to create a new zettel or to change an existing one, you have to use JSON.
There is an [[overview zettel for encoding formats|00001012920500]] that describes the valid formats.

Various parts of a zettel can be retrieved.
There are the [[possible values to specify zettel parts|00001012920800]].

=== Authentication
If [[authentication is enabled|00001010040100]], most API calls must include an [[access token|00001010040700]] that proves the identity of the caller.
* [[Authenticate an user|00001012050200]] to obtain an access token
* [[Renew an access token|00001012050400]] without costly re-authentication
* [[Provide an access token|00001012050600]] when doing an API call

=== Zettel lists
* [[List metadata of all zettel|00001012051200]]
* [[List all zettel, but in different encoding formats|00001012051400]]
* [[List all zettel, but include different parts of a zettel|00001012051600]]
* [[Shape the list of zettel metadata with filter options|00001012051800]]
* [[Sort the list of zettel metadata|00001012052000]]
* List all [[tags|00001006020000]] used in a Zettelstore
* List all [[roles|00001006020100]] used in a Zettelstore.
