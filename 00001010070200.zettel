For every zettel you can specify under which condition the zettel is visible to others.
This is controlled with the metadata key [[''visibility''|00001006020000#visibility]].
The following values are supported:

; [!public]""public""
: The zettel is visible to everybody, even if the user is not authenticated.
; [!login]""login""
: Only an authenticated user can access the zettel.

  This is the default value for [[''default-visibility''|00001004020000#default-visibility]].
; [!owner]""owner""
: Only the owner of the Zettelstore can access the zettel.

  This is for zettel with sensitive content, e.g. the [[configuration zettel|00001004020000]] or the various zettel that contains the templates for rendering zettel in HTML.
; [!expert]""expert""
: Only the owner of the Zettelstore can access the zettel, if runtime configuration [[''expert-mode''|00001004020000#expert-mode]] is set to a boolean true value.

  This is for zettel with sensitive content that might irritate the owner.
  Computed zettel with internal runtime information are examples for such a zettel.
; [!simple-expert]""simple-expert""
: The owner of the Zettelstore cab access the zettel, if expert mode is enabled, or if authentication is disabled and the Zettelstore is started without any command.

  The reason for this is to show all computed zettel to an user that started the Zettestore in simple mode.
  Many computed zettel should be given in error reporting and a new user might not be able to enable expert mode.

When you install a Zettelstore, only two zettel have visibility ""public"".
The first zettel is the zettel that contains CSS for displaying the web interface.
This is to ensure that the web interface looks nice even for not authenticated users.
The other zettel is the zettel containing the [[version|00000000000001]] of the Zettelstore.

Please note: if authentication is not enabled, every user has the same rights as the owner of a Zettelstore.
This is also true, if the Zettelstore runs additionally in [[read-only mode|00001004010000#read-only-mode]].
In this case, the [[runtime configuration zettel|00001004020000]] is shown (its visibility is ""owner"").
The [[startup configuration|00001004010000]] is not shown, because the associated computed zettel with identifier ''00000000000099'' is stored with the visibility ""expert"".
If you want to show such a zettel, you must set ''expert-mode'' to true.
