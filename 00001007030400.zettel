title: Zettelmarkup: Horizontal Rule

syntax: zmk
role: manual

To signal a thematic break, you can specify a horizonal rule.
This is done by entering at least three hyphen-minus characters (""''-''"", ''U+002D'') at the first position of a line.
You can add some [[attributes|00001007050000]], although the horizontal rule does not support the default attribute.
Any other character in this line will be ignored

If you do not enter the three hyphen-minus charachter at the very first position of a line, the are interpreted as [[inline elements|00001007040000]], typically as an ""en-dash" followed by a hyphen-minus.

Example:

```zmk
---
----{color=green}
-----
 --- inline
--- ignored
```
is rendered in HTML as
:::example
---
----{color=green}
-----
 --- inline
--- ignored
:::
