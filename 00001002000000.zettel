Zettelstore supports the following design goals:

; Longevity of stored notes / zettel
: Every zettel you create should be readable without the help of any tool, even without Zettelstore.
: It should be not hard to write other software that works with your zettel.
; Single user
: All zettel belong to you, only to you.
  Zettelstore provides its services only to one person: you.
  If your device is securely configured, there should be no risk that others are able to read or update your zettel.
: If you want, you can customize Zettelstore in a way that some specific or all persons are able to read some of your zettel.
; Ease of installation
: If you want to use the Zettelstore software, all you need is to copy the executable to an appropriate place and start working.
: Upgrading the software is done just by replacing the executable with a newer one.
; Ease of operation
: There is only one executable for Zettelstore and one directory, where your zettel are placed.
: If you decide to use multiple directories, you are free to configure Zettelstore appropriately.
; Multiple modes of operation
: You can use Zettelstore as a standalone software on your device, but you are not restricted to it.
: You can install the software on a central server, or you can install it on all your devices with no restrictions how to synchronize your zettel.
; Multiple user interfaces
: Zettelstore provides a default web-based user interface.
  Anybody can provide alternative user interfaces, e.g. for special purposes.
; Simple service
: The purpose of Zettelstore is to safely store your zettel and to provide some initial relations between them.
: External software can be written to deeply analyze your zettel and the structures they form.
