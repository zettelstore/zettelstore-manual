title: Use Markdown as the main markup language of Zettelstore
tags: #manual #markdown #zettelstore

If you are customized to use Markdown as your markup language, you can configure Zettelstore to support your decision.

Just add the key ''default-syntax'' with a value of ''md'' or ''markdown'' to the [[configuration zettel|00000000000100]].
Whether to use ''md'' or ''markdown'' is not just a matter to taste, but also depends on the value of ''zettel-file-syntax'' and, to some degree, on the value of ''yaml-header''.
All key are described [[here|00001004020000]].

If you set ''yaml-header'' to true, then new content is always stored in a file with the extension ''.zettel''.

Otherwise ''zettel-file-syntax'' lists all syntax values, where its content should be stored in a file with the extension ''.zettel''.

If neither ''yaml-header'' nor ''zettel-file-syntax'' is set, new content is stored in a file where its file name extension is the same as the syntax value of that zettel.
In this case it makes a difference, whether you specify ''md'' or ''markdown''.
If you specify the syntax ''md'', your content will be stored in a file with the ''.md'' extension.
Similar for the syntax ''markdown''.
If you want to process the files that store the zettel content, e.g. with some other Markdown tools, this may be important.
Not every Markdown tool allows both file extensions.

BTW, metadata is stored in a file with the extension ''.meta'', if neither ''yaml-header'' nor ''zettel-file-syntax'' is set.
