Region blocks does not directly have a visual representation.
They just group a range of lines.
You can use region blocks to enter [[attributes|00001007050000]] that apply only to this range of lines.
One example is to enter a multi-line warning that should be visible.

This kind of line-range block starts with at least three colon characters (""'':''"", ''U+003A'') at the first position of a line[^Since a [[description text|00001007030100]] only use exactly one colon character at the first position of a line, there is no possible ambiguity between these elements.].
You can add some [[attributes|00001007050000]] on the start line of a verse block, following the initiating characters.
The region block does not support the default attribute, but it supports the generic attribute.
Generic attributes, like ``=note``, ``=warning`` will be rendered special.
Attributes are interpreted on HTML rendering.
Any other character in this line will be ignored.

Text following the starting line will be interpreted, until a line starts with at least the same number of the same characters given at the starting line.
This allows to enter a region block within a reion block.
At the ending line, you can enter some [[inline elements|00001007040000]] after the colon characters.
These will interpreted as some attribution text.

For example:

```zmk
::::{style=color:green}
A region block with
 an embedded region block
:::{style=color:black}
Embedded
  region
block
::: Embedded Author
:::: Region Author
```
will be rendered as:
:::::
::::{style=color:green}
A region block with
 an embedded region block
:::{style=color:black}
Embedded
  region
block
::: Embedded Author
:::: Region Author
:::::

An example for a warning region block:
```zmk
:::warning
Do not copy from the Internet, know your sponsors.
:::
```
will be rendered as:
::::
:::warning
Do not copy from the Internet, know your sponsors.
