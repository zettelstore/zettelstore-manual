A simple way to enter a quotation is to use the [[quotation list|00001007030200]].
A quotation list loosely follows the convention of quoting text within emails.
However, if you want to attribute the quotation to seomeone, a quotation block is more appropriately.

This kind of line-range block starts with at least three less-than characters (""''<''"", ''U+003C'') at the first position of a line.
You can add some [[attributes|00001007050000]] on the start line of a quotation block, following the initiating characters.
The quotation does not support the default attribute, nor the generic attribute.
Attributes are interpreted on HTML rendering.
Any other character in this line will be ignored

Text following the starting line will be interpreted, until a line starts with at least the same number of the same characters given at the starting line.
This allows to enter a quotation block within a quotation block.
At the ending line, you can enter some [[inline elements|00001007040000]] after the less-than characters.
These will interpreted as some attribution text.

For example:

```zmk
<<<<
A quotation with an embedded quotation
<<<{style=color:green}
Embedded
<<< Embedded Author
<<<<
```
will be rendered in HTML as:
:::example
<<<<
A quotation with an embedded quotation
<<<{style=color:green}
Embedded
<<< Embedded Author
<<<< Quotation Author
