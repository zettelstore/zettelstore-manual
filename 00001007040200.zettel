There are three reasons to mark text that should be rendered as uninterpreted:

# Mark text as literal, sometimes as part of a program.
# Mark text as input you give into a computer via a keyboard.
# Mark text as output from some computer, e.g. shown at the command line.

=== Literal text
Literal text somehow relates to [[verbatim blocks|00001007030500]]: their content should not be interpreted further, but may be rendered special.
It is specified by two grave accent characters (""''`''"", ''U+0060''), followed by the text, followed by again two grave accent characters, optionally followed by an [[attribute|00001007050000]] specification.
Similar to the verbatim block, the literal element allows also a modifier letter grave accent (""''Ë‹''"", ''U+02CB'') as an alternative to the grave accent character[^On some devices, such as an iPhone / iPad, a grave accent character is harder to enter and is often confused with a modifier letter grave accent.].
However, all four characters must be the same.

The literal element supports the default attribute: when given, all spaces in the text are rendered in HTML as open box characters (""''&#x2423;''"", ''U+2423'').
The use of a generic attribute allwos to specify a (programming) language that controls syntax colouring when rendered in HTML.

If you want to specify a grave accent character in the text, either use modifier grave accent characters as delimiters for the element, or place a backslash character before the grave accent character you want to use inside the element.
If you want to enter a backslash character, you need to enter two of these.

Examples:
* ``\`\`abc def\`\``` is rendered in HTML as ::``abc def``::{=example}.
* ``\`\`abc def\`\`{-}`` is rendered in HTML as ::``abc def``{-}::{=example}.
* ``\`\`abc\\\`def\`\``` is rendered in HTML as ::``abc\`def``::{=example}.
* ``\`\`abc\\\\def\`\``` is rendered in HTML as ::``abc\\def``::{=example}.

=== Keyboard input
To mark text as input into a computer program, delimit your text with two plus sign characters (""''+''"", ''U+002B'') on each side.

Example:
* ``++STRG-C++`` renders in HTML as ::++STRG-C++::{=example}.
* ``++STRG C++{-}`` renders in HTML as ::++STRG C++{-}::{=example}.

Attributes can be specified, the default attribute has the same semantic as for literal text.

=== Computer output
To mark text as output from a computer program, delimit your text with two equal sign characters (""''=''"", ''U+003D'') on each side.

Examples:
* ``==The result is: 42==`` renders in HTML as ::==The result is: 42==::{=example}.
* ``==The result is: 42=={-}`` renders in HTML as ::==The result is: 42=={-}::{=example}.

Attributes can be specified, the default attribute has the same semantic as for literal text.
