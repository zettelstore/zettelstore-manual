It is possible to enable the read-only mode of the Zettelstore //and// authentication/authorization.
Both modes are independent from each other.
This gives four use cases:

; Not read-only, no authorization
: Zettelstore runs on your local computer and you work with it.
; Not read-only, with authorization
: Zettelstore is accessed remotely.
  You need authentication to ensure that only valid users access your Zettelstore.
; With read-only, no authorization
: Zettelstore present publicly its full content to everybody.
; With read-only, with autorization
: Nobody is allowed to change the content of the Zettelstore, but only specific zettel should be presented to the public.
