The configuration file, as specified by the ''-c CONFIGFILE'' [[command line option|00001004051000]], allows you to specify some start-up options.
These options cannot be stored in a [[configuration zettel|00001004020000]] because either they are needed before Zettelstore can start or because of security reasons.
For example, Zettelstore need to know in advance, on which network address is must listen or where zettel are placed.
An attacker that is able to change the owner can do anything.
Therefore only the owner of the computer on which Zettelstore runs can change this information.

The file for start-up configuration must be created via a text editor in advance.

The syntax of the configuration file is the same as for any zettel metadata.
The following keys are supported:

; [!insecure-cookie]''insecure-cookie''
: Must be set to ''true'', if authentication is enabled and Zettelstore is not accessible not via HTTPS (but via HTTP).
  Otherwise web browser are free to ignore the authentication cookie.

  Default: ''false''
; [!listen-addr]''listen-addr''
: Configures the network address, where is zettel web service is listening for requests.
  Syntax is: ''[NETWORKIP]:PORT'', where ''NETWORKIP'' is the IP-address of the networking interface (or something like ''0.0.0.0'' if you want to listen on all network interfaces, and ''PORT'' is the TCP port.

  Default value: ''"127.0.0.1:23123"''
; [!owner]''owner''
: [[Identifier|00001006050000]] of a zettel that contains data about the owner of the Zettelstore.
  The owner has full authorization for the Zettelstore.
  Only if owner is set to some value, user [[authentication|00001010000000]] is enabled.
; [!persistent-cookie]''persistent-cookie''
: A boolean value to make the access cookie persistent.
  This is helpful if you access the Zettelstore via a mobile device.
  On these devices, the operating system is free to stop the web browser and to remove temporary cookies.
  Therefore, an authenticated user will be logged off.

  If ''true'', a persistent cookie is used.
  Its lifetime exceeds the lifetime of the authentication token (see option ''token-lifetime-html'') by 30 seconds.

  Default: ''false''
; [!place-X-uri]''place-//X//-uri'', where //X// is a number greater or equal to one
: Specifies a [[place|00001004011200]] where zettel are stored.
  During startup //X// is counted, starting with one, until no key is found.
  This allows to configure more than one place.

  If no ''place-1-uri'' key is given, the overall effect will be the same as if only ''place-1-uri'' was specified with the value ''dir://.zettel''.
  In this case, even a key ''place-2-uri'' will be ignored.
; [!read-only-mode]''read-only-mode''
: Puts the Zettelstore web service into a read-only mode.
  No changes are possible.
  Default: false.
; [!token-lifetime-api]''token-lifetime-api'', [!token-lifetime-html]''token-lifetime-html''
: Define lifetime of access tokens in minutes.
  Values are only valid if authentication is enabled, i.e. key ''owner'' is set.

  ''token-lifetime-api'' is for accessing Zettelstore via its API.
  Default: 10.

  ''token-lifetime-html'' specifies the lifetime for the HTML views.
  Default: 60.
  It is automatically extended, when a new HTML view is rendered.
; [!url-prefix]''url-prefix''
: Add the given string as a prefix to the local part of a Zettelstore local URL/URI when rendering zettel representations.
  Must start and end with a slash character (""''/''"", ''U+002F'').
  Default: ''"/"''.

  This allows to use a forwarding proxy [[server|00001010090100]] in front of the Zettelstore.
; ''verbose''
: Be more verbose inf logging data.
  Default: false

Other keys will be ignored.
