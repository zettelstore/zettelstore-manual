Every zettelmark content consists of a sequence of Unicode codepoints.
Unicode codepoints are called in the following as **character**s.

Characters are encoded with UTF-8.

The character ''U+0000'' is replaced with the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (''U+FFFD'').

A **line** is a sequence of characters, except newline (''U+000A'') and carraige return (''U+000D''), followed by a line ending sequence or the end of content.

A **line ending** is either a newline not followed by a carriage return, a newline followed by a carriage return, or a carriage return.
Different line can be finalized by different line endings.

An **empty line** is an empty sequence of characters, followed by a line ending or the end of content.

The **space** character is the Unicode codepoint ''U+0020''.

All Unicode control characters, except newline and carriage return, are replaced with a space character.
These are the Unicode codepoints 1--9, 11, 12, 14--31, and 127--159.
