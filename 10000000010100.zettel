Any document can be thought as a sequence of paragraphs and other blocks-structural elements (""blocks""), such as headings, lists, quotations, and code blocks.
Some of these blocks can contain other blocks, for example lists may contain other lists or paragraphs.
Other blocks contain inline-structural elements (""inlines""), such as text, links, emphasized text, and images.

With the exception of lists, the markup for blocks always starts at the first position of a line and starts with three or more identical characters.
List blocks also starts at the first position of a line, but may need one or more character, plus a space character.
Non-list blocks are either fully specified on that line or they span multiple lines and are delimited with the same three or more character.
It depends on the block kind, whether blocks are specified on one line or on at least two lines.

If a line does not start with an explicit block element. the line is treated as a (implicit) paragraph block element that contains inline elements.
This paragraph ends when a block element is detected at the beginning of a next line or when an empty line occurs.
Some blocks may also contain inline elements, e.g. a heading.

Inline elements mostly starts with two non-space, often identical characters.
With some exceptions, two identical non-space characters starts a formatting range that is ended with the same two characters.

Exceptions are: links, images, edits, comments, and both the ""n-dash"" and the ""horizontal ellipsis"".
A link is given with ``[[...]]``{=zmk}, an images with ``{{...}}``{=zmk}, and an edit formatting with ``((...))``{=zmk}.
An inline comment, starting with the sequence ``%%``{=zmk}, always ends at the end of the line where it begins.
The ""n-dash"" is specified as ``--``{=zmk}, the ""horizontal ellipsis"" as ``...``{=zmk} if placed at the end of non-space text.

Some inline elements do not follow the rule of two identical character, especially to specify footnotes, bibliographical keys, and local marks.
These elements start with one opening square bracket (""``[``""), use a character for specifying the kind of the inline, typically allow to specify some content, and end with one closing square bracket (""``]``"").

One inline element that does not start with two characters is the ""entity"".
It allows to specify any Unicode character.
The specification of that character is placed between an ampersand character and a semicolon: ``&...;``{=zmk}.
For exmple, an ""n-dash"" could also be specified as ``&ndash;``{==zmk}.

The backslash character (""``\\``"") possibly gives the next character a special meaning.
This allows to resolve some left ambiguities.
For example, list of depth 2 will start a line with ``** Item 2.2``{=zmk}.
An inline element to strongly emphasize some text start with a space will be specified as ``** Text**``{=zmk}.
To force the inline element formatting at the start of a line, ``**\\ Text**``{=zmk} should better be specified.

Many block and inline elements can be refined by additional attributes.
Attributes resemble roughly HTML attributes and are placed near the corresponding elements by using the syntax ``{...}``{=zmk}.
One example is to make space characters visible inside a inline code element: ``1 + 2 = 3``{-} was specified by using the default attribute: ``\`\`1 + 2 = 3\`\`{-}``.

To summarize:

* With some exceptions, blocks-structural elements starts at the for position of a line with three identical characters.
* The most important exception to this rule is the specification of lists.
* If no block element is found, a paragraph with inline elements is assumed.
* With some exceptions, inline-structural elements starts with two characters, quite often the same two characters.
* The most important exceptions are links.
* The backslash character can help to resolve possible ambiguities.
* Attributes refine some block and inline elements.
* Block elements have a higher priority than inline elements.

These principles makes automatic recognizing zettelmarkup an (relatively) easy task.
By looking at the reference implementation, a moderately skilled software developer should be able to create a appropriate software in a different programming language.
