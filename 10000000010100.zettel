Any document can be thought as a sequence of paragraphs and other blocks-structural elements (""blocks""), such as headings, lists, quotations, and code blocks.
Some of these blocks can contain other blocks, for example lists may contain other lists or paragraphs.
Other blocks contain inline-structural elements (""inlines""), such as text, links, emphasized text, and images.

The markup for blocks always start at the first position of a line and starts with three identical characters[^There is one exception: the topmost heading will start with the sequence ``== ``{=zmk -} (two equal signs plus a space).].
