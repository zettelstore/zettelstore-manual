An important aspect of knowledge work is to interconnect your zettel as well as provide links to (external) material.

There are several kinds of references that are allowed in Zettelmarkup:

* Links to other zettel.
* Links to (external material).
* Embed images that are stored within your Zettelstore.
* Embed external images.
* Reference via a footnote.
* Reference via a bibliographic key.
* Put a mark within your zettel that you can reference later with a link.

=== Links

There are two kinds of links, regardless of links to (internal) other zettel or to (external) material.
Both kinds starts with two consecutive left square bracket characters (""''[''"", ''U+005B'') and ends with two consecutive right square bracket characters (""'']''"", ''U+005D'').

The first form just provides a link specification between the square brackets.
The second form provide some text plus the link specification, delimited by a vertical bar character (""''|''"", ''U+007C'').

# ``[[linkspecification]]``
# ``[[text|linkspecification]]``

If the first form is given, the text is derived from the link specification, e.g. by interpreting the link specification as text.

The link specification for another zettel within the same zettelstore is just the [[zettel identification|00001006000000]].
To reference some content within a zettel, you can append a number sign character (""''#''"", ''U+0023'') and the name of the mark to the zettel identification.

To specify some (external) material outside the zettelstore, just use an normal Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as defined by [[RFC\ 3986|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986]].

The text in the second form is just a sequence of inline elements.

=== Images

To some degree, an image specification is conceptually near a link specification.
Both contain a link specification and optionally some text.
In contrast to a link, the link specification of an image must resolve to actual graphical image data.
That data is read when rendered as HTML, and is embedded inside the zettel as an inline image.

An image specification starts with two consecutive left curly bracket characters (""''{''"", ''U+007B'') and ends with two consecutive right curly bracket characters (""''}''"", ''U+007D'').
The curly brackets delimits either a link specification or some text, a vertical bar character and the link specification, similar to a link.

One difference to a link: if the text was not given, an empty string is assumed.

The link specification must reference a graphical image representation if the image is about to be rendered.
Supported formats are:

* Portable Network Graphics (""PNG""), as defined by [[RFC\ 2083|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2083]].
* Graphics Interchange Format (""GIF"), as defined by [[https://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt]].
* JPEG / JPG, defined by the //Joint Photographic Experts Group//.
* Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), defined by [[https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/]]

If the text is given, it will be interpreted as an alternative textual representation, to help persons with some visual disabilities.

[[Attributes|00001007050000]] are supported.
They must follow the last right curly bracket character immediately.
One prominent example is to specify an explicit title attribute that is shown on certain web browsers when the zettel is rendered in HTML:

Example:

``{{External link|00000000030001}}{title=External width=30}`` is rendered as ::{{External link|00000000030001}}{title=External width=30}::{=example}.

=== Footnotes

A footnote starts with a left square bracket, followed by a circumflex accent (""''^''"", ''U+005E''), followed by some text, and ends with a right square bracket.

Example:

``Main text[^Footnote text.].`` is rendered in HTML as: ::Main text[^Footnote text.].::{=example}.

=== Bibliographic key

A bibliographic key references some external material that is part of a bibliografical collection.

Currently, the zettelstore implements this only partially, it is ""work in progress"".

However, the syntax is: starting with a left square bracket and followed by an at sign character (""''@''"", ''U+0040''), a the bibliographic key is given.
The key is typically a sequence of letters and digits.
If a comma character (""'',''"", ''U+002C'') or a vertical bar character is given, the following is interpreted as inline elements.
A right square bracket ends the text and the bibliographic key element.

=== Mark
A mark allows to name a point within a zettel.
This is useful if you want to reference some content in a bigger-sized zettel[^Other uses of marks will be given, if Zettelmarkup is extended by a concept called //transclusion//.].

A mark starts with a left square bracket, followed by an exclamation mark character (""''!''"", ''U+0021'').
Now the optional mark name follows.
It is a (possibly empty) sequence of Unicode letters, Unicode digits, the hyphen-minus character (""''-''"", ''U+002D''), or the low-line character (""''_''"", ''U+005F'').
The mark element ends with a right square bracket.

Examples:
* ``[!]`` is a mark without a name, the empty mark.
* ``[!mark]`` is a mark with the name ""mark"".
