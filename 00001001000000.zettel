[[Personal knowledge
management|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management]] is
about collecting, classifying, storing, searching, retrieving, assessing,
evaluating, and sharing knowledge as a daily activity. Personal knowledge
management is done by most people, not necessarily as part of their main
business. It is essential for knowledge workers, like students, researchers,
lecturers, software developers, scientists, engineers, architects, to name
a few. Many hobbyists build up a significant amount of knowledge, even if the
do not need to think for a living. Personal knowledge management can be seen as
a prerequisite for many kinds of collaboration.

Zettelstore is a software that collects and relates your notes (""zettel"")
to represent and enhance your knowledge. It helps with many tasks of personal
knowledge management by explicitly supporting the ""[[Zettelkasten
method|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten]]"". The method is based on
creating many individual notes, each with one idea or information, that are
related to each other. Since knowledge is typically build up gradually, one
major focus is a long-term store of these notes, hence the name
""Zettelstore"".
