Installing Zettelstore as a Linux service is not that hard.

Grab the appropriate executable and copy it into the appropriate directory:
```sh
# sudo mv zettelstore /usr/local/bin/zettelstore
```
Create a group named ''zettelstore'':
```sh
# sudo groupadd --system zettelstore
```
Create a system user of that group, named ''zettelstore'', with a home folder:
```sh
# sudo useradd --system --gid zettelstore \
    --create-home --home-dir /var/lib/zettelstore \
    --shell /usr/sbin/nologin \
    --comment "Zettelstore server" \
    zettelstore
```
Create a systemd service file and place it into ''/etc/systemd/system/zettelstore.service'':
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Zettelstore
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=zettelstore
Group=zettelstore
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/zettelstore run -d /var/lib/zettelstore
WorkingDirectory=/var/lib/zettelstore

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Double-check everything. Now you can enable and start the zettelstore as a service:
```sh
# sudo systemctl daemon-reload
# sudo systemctl enable zettelstore
# sudo systemctl start zettelstore
```
Use the commands ``systemctl``{=sh} and ``journalctl``{=sh} to manage the service, e.g.:
```sh
# sudo systemctl status zettelstore  # verify that it is running
# sudo journalctl -u zettelstore     # obtain the output of the running zettelstore
```
