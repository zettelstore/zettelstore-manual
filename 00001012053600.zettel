title: API: Retrieve references of an existing zettel
tags: #api #manual #zettelstore
syntax: zmk
role: manual

The web of zettel is one important value of a Zettelstore.
Many zettel references other zettel, images, external/local material or, via citations, external literature.
By using the [[endpoint|00001012920000]] ''/l/{ID}'' you are able to retrieve these references.

=== Kind
The following to-level JSON keys are returned:
; ''id''
: The zettel identifier for which the references were requested.
; ''url''
: The API endpoint to fetch more information about the zettel.
; ''link''
: A JSON object that contains information about incoming and outgoing [[links|00001007040300#links]].
; ''image''
: A JSON object that contains information about referenced [[images|00001007040300#images]].
; ''cite''
: A JSON list of [[citation keys|00001007040300#citation-key]] (as JSON strings).

The query parameter ''kind'' controls which of these values is retrieved:

|= ''kind'' <| Number >| Returned values
| (nothing) | (14) |links, images, and citation keys
| ''link'' | 2|links 
| ''image'' | 4|images
| ''cite'' | 8|citation keys
| ''both'' | (6)|links and images
| ''all'' | (14)|links, images, and citation keys

The ""Number"" column gives an indication about an alternative way of specifying the kind.
Every kind is given a number, which you also can use to specify the requested kind of reference.
To get more than one kind, just add the numbers.
If you want to retrieve only images and citations, which was not given a ''kind'' value, just specify ''kind=12''.
=== Matter
If you request to retrieve referenced links and/or referenced images, you can further control, which matter of references should be retrieved.
This is controlled by the value of the query parameter ''matter'':
|= ''matter''| Number >| Returned reference list
| (nothing) | (30) | incoming, outgoing, local, and external references
| ''incoming'' | 2|incoming reference, not allowed for images (aka ""backlinks"", not yet implemented)
| ''outgoing'' | 4|outgoing references
| ''local'' | 8|local references, i.e. local, non-zettel material
| ''external'' |16| external references, i.e. on the web
| ''zettel'' | (6)|incoming and outgoing references
| ''material'' |(24)| local and external references
| ''all'' | (30)| incoming, outgoing, local, and external references

Incoming and outgoing references are basically zettel.
Therefore the list elements are JSON objects with keys ''id'' and ''url''.
Local and external references are strings.

Similar to the ''kind'' query parameter, each matter is associated with a number.
To retrieve a combination of matter values that does not have a name, just add the numbers.
For example, if you want to retrieve only the outgoing and the external references, specify ''matter=20''.

If a list is not going to retrieved, the associated value is ``null``{=json} instead of an empty list.
=== HTTP Status codes
; ''200''
: Retrieval was successful, the body contains an appropriate JSON object.
; ''400''
: Request was not valid. 
  There are several reasons for this.
  Maybe the zettel identifier did not consist of exactly 14 digits or ''_format'' / ''_part'' contained illegal values.
; ''403''
: You are not allowed to retrieve data of the given zettel.
; ''404''
: Zettel not found.
  You probably used a zettel identifier that is not used in the Zettelstore.
