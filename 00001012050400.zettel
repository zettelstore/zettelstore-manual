title: API: Renew an access token

An access token is only valid for a certain duration.
Since the [[authentication process|00001012050200]] will need some processing time, there is a way to renew the token without providing full authentication data.

Send a HTTP PUT request to the endpoint ''/a'' and include the current acess token in the ''Authorization'' header:

```sh
# curl -X PUT -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN' http://127.0.0.1:23123/a
{"access_token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJfdGsiOjEsImV4cCI6MTYwMTczMTI3NSwiaWF0IjoxNjAxNzMwNjc1LCJzdWIiOiJhYmMiLCJ6aWQiOiIyMDIwMTAwMzE1MDEwMCJ9.ekhXkvn146P2bMKFQcU-bNlvgbeO6sS39hs6U5EKfjIqnSInkuHYjYAIfUqf_clYRfr6YBlX5izii8XfxV8jhg","token_type":"Bearer","expires_in":456}
```

You may receive a new token, or the current one if it was obtained not a long time ago.
However, the lifetime of the returned [[access token|00001012921000]] is accurate.

=== HTTP Status codes
; ''200''
: Renew process was successful, the body contains an [[appropriate JSON object|00001012921000]].
; ''400''
: Authorization was not successful.
  There are several reasons for this.
  Maybe authorization was not [[enabled|00001010040100]], or the access bearer token was not valid.

  Probably you should [[authenticate|00001012050200]] again with user identification and password.
