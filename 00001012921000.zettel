If the [[authentiction process|00001012050200]] was successful, an access token with some additional data is returned.
The same is true, if the access token was [[renewed|00001012050400]].
The response is structured as an JSON object, with the following named values:

|''token_type''|The type of the token, always set to ''Bearer'', as described in [[RFC 6750|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750]]
|''expires_in''|An integer that gives a hint about the lifetime / endurance of the token, measured in seconds
