With this version, Zettelstore and this manual got a new license, the ""[[European Union Public Licence|https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl]]"" (EUPL), version 1.2 or later.
Nothing else changed.

If you want to stay with the old licenses (AGPLv3+, CC BY-SA 4.0), you are free to fork from the previous versions (v0.0.6).
