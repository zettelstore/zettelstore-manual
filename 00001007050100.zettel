title: Zettelmarkup: Supported Attribute Values for Natural Languages
tags: #manual #reference #zettelmarkup #zettelstore
syntax: zmk
role: manual

With an [[attribute|00001007050000]] it is possible to specify the natural language of a text region.
This is important, if you want to render your markup into an environment, where this is significant.
HTML is such an environment.

To specify the language within an attribute, you must use the key ''lang''.
The language itself is specified according to the language definition of [[RFC-5646|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5646]].

Examples:
* ``{lang=en}`` for the english language
* ``{lang=en-us}`` for the english dialect spoken in the United States of America
* ``{lang=de}`` for the german language
* ``{lang=de-at}`` for the german language dialect spoken in Austria
* ``{lang=de-de}`` for the german language dialect spoken in Germany

The actual [[typographic quotations marks|00001007040100]] (``""...""``) are derived from the current language.
The language of a zettel (meta key ''lang'') or of the whole zettelstore (''default-lang'' of the [[configuration zettel|00001004020000]]) can be overwritten by an attribute: ``""...""{lang=fr}``{=zmk}.
Currently, the zettelstore supports the following primary languages:

* ''de''
* ''en''
* ''fr''

These are used, even if a dialect was specified.
