Tables are used to show some data in a two-dimenensional fashion.
In zettelmarkup, table are not specified explicitly, but by entering //table rows//.
Therefore, a table can be seen as a sequence of table rows.
A table row is nothing as a sequence of //table cells//.
The length of a table is the number of table rows, the width of a table is the maximum length of its rows.

The first cell of a row must start with the vertical bar character (""''|''"", ''U+007C'') at the first position of a line.
The other cells of a row start with the same vertical bar character at later positions in that line.
A cell is delimited by the vertical bar character of the next cell or by the end of the current line.
A vertical bar character as the last character of a line will not result in a table cell.
It will be ignored.
Inside a cell, you can specify any [[inline elements|00001007040000]].

For example:
```zmk
| a1 | a2 | a3|
| b1 | b2 | b3
| c1 | c2
```
will be rendered in HTML as:
:::
| a1 | a2 | a3|
| b1 | b2 | b3
| c1 | c2
:::

If any cell in the first row of a table contains an equal sing character (""''=''"", ''U+003D'') as the very first character, then this first row will be interpreted as a //table header// row.

For example:
```zmk
| a1 | a2 |= a3|
| b1 | b2 | b3
| c1 | c2
```
will be rendered in HTML as:
:::
| a1 | a2 |= a3|
| b1 | b2 | b3
| c1 | c2
:::

Inside a header row, you can specify the alignment of each header cell by a given character as the last character of a cell.
The alignment of a header cell determines the alignment of every cell in the same column.
The following characters specify the alignment:

* the colon character (""'':''"", ''U+003A'') forces a centered aligment,
* the less-than sign character (""''<''"", ''U+0060'') specifies an alignment to the left,
* the greater-than sign character (""''>''"", ''U+0062'') will produce right aligned cells.

If no alignment character is given, a default alignment is used.

For example:
```zmk
|=Left<|Right>|Center:|Default
|123456|123456|123456|123456|
|123|123|123|123
```
will be rendered in HTML as:
:::
|=Left<|Right>|Center:|Default
|123456|123456|123456|123456|
|123|123|123|123
:::

To specify the alignment of an individual cell, you can enter these characters for alignment as the first character of that cell.

For example:
```zmk
|=Left<|Right>|Center:|Default
|>R|:C|<L
|123456|123456|123456|123456|
|123|123|123|123
```
will be rendered in HTML as:
:::
|=Left<|Right>|Center:|Default
|>R|:C|<L
|123456|123456|123456|123456|
|123|123|123|123
