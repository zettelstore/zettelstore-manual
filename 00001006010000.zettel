title: Syntax of Meta Data

The meta data of a zettel is a collection og key-value pairs.
The syntax roughly resembles the internal header of an email ([[RFC5322|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322]]).

The key is a sequence of alphanumeric characters, a hyphen-minus character (""''-''"") is also allowed.
It starts at a new line.

A key is separated from its value either by
* a colon character (""'':''""), 
* a non-empty sequence of space characters, 
* a sequence of space characters, followed by a colon, followed by a sequence of space characters.

A Value is a sequence of printable characters.
If the value should be continued in the following line, that following line (//continuation line//) must start with a non-empty sequence of space characters.
The rest of the following line will be interpreted as the next part of the value.
There can be more than one continuation line for a value.

A non-continuation line that contains a possibly empty sequence of characters, followed by the percent sign character (""''%''"") is treated as a comment line.
It will be ignored.

Parsing meta data ends, if an empty line is found or if a line with at least three hyphen-minus characters is found.

Some examples:

```meta
title1:The Title
 title-2 : Another title
title-3: A wrapped
 title
title-4: A
 wrapped
 title
 with
 more
 than
 one
  continuation
 line
% A comment line
 % Another comment line.

No meta data anymore, because of the empty line.
```
