Zettelstore is not just a web service that provides services of a zettelkasten.
It allows to some tasks to be executed at the command line.
Typically, the task (""sub-command"") will be given at the command line as the first parameter.

If no parameter is given, the Zettelstore is called as
```
zettelstore
```
This is equivalent to call it this way:
```sh
mkdir ./zettel
zettelstore run -d ./zettel -c ./.zscfg
```
Typically this is done by starting Zettelstore via a graphical user interface by double-clicking to its file icon.
