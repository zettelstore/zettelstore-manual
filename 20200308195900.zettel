title: Paragraphs in Zettelmarkup
tags: #zmk
role: manual

Each line that has no syntax element for vertical material is considered to be
part of a paragraph. In case of enumeration lists, bullet lists, and definition
lists, two or more spaces at the start of a line can be a syntax element.

This has the implication that a mistyped syntax element for vertical material
will be part of the paragraph. For example:
```zmk
= Heading
Some text follows.
```

will be rendered as

:::
= Heading
Some text follows.
:::

This is because, there are no level 1 headings.

Paragraphs are separated by empty lines.
