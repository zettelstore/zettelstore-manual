role: manual

This is the default representation of a zettel or a list of zettel.
Basically, user provided data is encoded as a string (zettel content and metadata values),
The metadata and some other structuring data is encoded a JSON object.

The JSON objects contains various name/value pairs, depending which content should be encoded:

* ''"id"'': the [[zettel identifier|00001006050000]], as a string.
* ''"url"'': the base URL to the zettel, as a string.
* ''"meta"'': the metadata of the zettel, as an JSON object. See below for details.
* ''"encoding"'' and ''"content"'': the actual content of the zettel. See below for details.

''"id"'' and ''"url"'' are always sent to the client.
It depends on the value of the required [[zettel part|00001012920800]], whether ''"meta"'' or ''"content"'' or both are sent.

For an example, take a look at the JSON encoding of this page, which is available via the ""Info"" sub-page of this zettel: 

* [[../z/00001012920501?_part=id]],
* [[../z/00001012920501?_part=zettel]],
* [[../z/00001012920501?_part=meta]],
* [[../z/00001012920501?_part=content]].

If transferred via HTTP, the content type will be ''application/json''.

=== Metadata
This ia a JSON object, that maps [[metadata keys|00001006010000]] to their values.
Their values are encoded as strings, even if they contain a number (or something else).

You can always expect the keys ''"title"'', ''"tags"'', ''"syntax"'', and ''"role"'', together with their values.
The Zettelstore provides default values for these values, if they are not set for a zettel.

There is a list of [[supported metadata keys|00001006020000]].

=== Content
When the content is text-only, it is encoded as a plain string with an ''"encoding"'' value of ''""'' (empty string).

If the content contains binary content:

* ''"encoding"'' specifies the string encoding of the content.
  Currently, only the value ''"base64"'' is supported (as described in [[RFC4648, section 4|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4]].
* ''"value"'' is a string that contains the encoded binary content.

For example, if the content just consists of three zero bytes, it will be encoded as ``(...),"encoding":"base64","value":"AAAA"``{=json}.
