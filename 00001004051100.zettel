=== ``zettelstore run-simple``
This sub-command is implicitly called, when an user starts Zettelstore by double-clicking on its GUI icon.
It is s simplified variant of the [[''run'' sub-command|00001004051000]].

It allows only to specify a zettel directory.
The directory will be created automatically, if it does not exist.
This is the only difference to the ''run'' sub-command, where the directory must exists.

```
zettelstore run-simple [-d DIR]
```

; [!d]''-d DIR''
: Specifies ''DIR'' as the directory that contains all zettel.

  Default is ''./zettel'' (''.\\zettel'' on Windows), where ''.'' denotes the ""current directory"".
