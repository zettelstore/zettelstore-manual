Your zettel could contain sensitive content.
You probably want to ensure that only authorized person can read and/or modify them.
Zettelstore ensures this in various ways.

=== Local first
The Zettelstore is designed to run on your local computer.
If you do not configure it in other ways, no person from another computer can connect to your Zettelstore.
You must explicitly configure it to allow access from other computers.

In the case that your own multiple computers, you do not have to access the Zettelstore remotely.
You could install Zettelstore on each computer and set-up some software to synchronize your zettel.
Since zettel are stored as ordinary files, this task could be done in various ways.

=== Read-only
You can start the Zettelstore in an read-only mode.
Nobody, not even you as the owner of the Zettelstore, can change something via its interfaces[^However, as an owner, you have access to these files that store the zettel. If you modify the files, these changes will be reflected via its interfaces.].

You enable read-only mode through the key ''readonly'' in the [[start-up configutation zettel|00001004010000]] or with the ''-r'' option of the ``zettelstore run`` sub-command.

=== Authentication
The Zettelstore can be configured that a user must authenticate itself to gain access to the content.
To enable authentication, you must create a zettel that stores the authentication data.
Then you must reference this zettel within the [[start-up configuration|00001004010000]] under the key ''owner''.
Once the start-up configuration contains a valid zettel identification under that key, authentication is enabled.

* [[Authenticated sessions|00001010040700]]

=== Authorization
Once you have enabled authentication, it is possible to allow others to access your Zettelstore.
Maybe, others should be able to read some or all of your zettel.
Or you want to allow them to create new zettel, or to change them.
It is up to you.

If someone is authenticated as the owner of the Zettelstore (hopefully you), no restriction apply.
But as an owner, you can create ""user zettel"" to allow others to access your Zettelstore in various ways.
Even if you do not want to share your Zettelstore with other persons, creating user zettel can be useful if you plan to access your Zettelstore via the API.

Additionally, you can specify that a zettel is publicily visible.
In this case no one has to authenticate itself to see the content of the zettel.
Or you can specify that a zettel is visible to the owner.
In this case, no authenticated user will be able to read and change that protected zettel.

* [[Authorization and read-only mode|00001010070400]]
* [[Access rules|00001010070600]] define the policy which user is allowed to do what operation.

=== Encryption
When the Zettelstore is accessed remotely, the messages that are sent between the Zettestore and the client must be encrypted.
Otherwise, an eavesdropper could fetch sensible data, such as passwords or precious content that is not for the public.

The Zettelstore itself does not encrypt messages.
But you can put a server in front of it, which is able to handle encryption.
For example, many web server software allows this.

To enforce encryption, [[authentication sessions|00001010040700]] are marked secure by default.
If you still want to access the Zettelstore remotely without encryption, you must change the start-up configuration.
Otherwise, authentication will not work.
